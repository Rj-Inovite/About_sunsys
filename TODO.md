# TODO List for Banner Section Update

- [x] Update slidingTexts array in App.jsx to include original and new phrases
- [x] Modify sliding animation in App.jsx to fix overlapping text (use sequential fade without absolute positioning)
- [x] Edit App.css to shift banner section text towards the left (change text-align and add left margin)
- [x] Test the animation and alignment in the browser
